# Info aifTech Internship Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Info aifTech internship." In this internship, I have worked on various data analysis tasks involving different types of data. Here's a brief overview of the tasks I have completed:

## Task 1: Iris Classification
In Task 1, I focused on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for machine learning. I implemented a classification model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. This task involved data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Task 2: Movie Recommendation System
Task 2 revolved around building a movie recommendation system. I leveraged collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. This involved data collection, feature engineering, and the implementation of recommendation algorithms.

## Task 3: Credit Card Fraud Detection
For Task 3, I worked on the critical problem of credit card fraud detection. I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. This task included data preprocessing, model training, and evaluating the model's performance in terms of fraud detection.
